# MathWorks-Fraction
Implemented a Fraction Class with Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Equality, Non-Equality, Greater Than, Less Than and Display Functionality. 

Also can convert Valid Fractions to Double and Int values.

## This repository contains 3 files:
1) Fraction.h - contains the class declaration along with function declarations and explanations for its purpose.
2) Fraction.cpp - contains the function definitions. 
3) main.cpp - calls to all functions for testing and verification.

## Improvement Ideas:
1) Give an option to the user if the fraction after calculations needs to be reduced or not.
2) Implement support for floating number fractions.
3) Generalize for other types using templates.
