# Fraction Class Implementation:

## This repository contains 3 files:
1) Fraction.h - contains the class declaration along with function declarations and explanations for its purpose.
2) Fraction.cpp - contains the function definitions. 
3) main.cpp - calls to all functions for testing and verification.

## Overloaded Operators:
  1) Addition (+, +=) 
  2) Subtraction (-, -=) 
  3) Multiplication (*, *=) 
  4) Division (/, /=)
  5) Equality (==)
  6) Assignment( = using copy constructor)
  7) Non-Equality (!=)
  8) Greater Than or equal to (> , >=) 
  9) Less Than or equal to (<,<=)
  10) Display using ostream(cout)
## Other Functions are:
  1) Reduce Fraction
  2) Check if Valid
  3) Convert to Decimal
  4) Convert to Rounded up Integer
  
## Improvement Ideas:
1) Give an option to the user if the fraction after calculations needs to be reduced or not.
2) Implement support for floating number fractions.
3) Generalize for other types using templates.
